# smart-parking
A Deep Learning-based system to identify vacant and occupied lots in car parkings.

<h2>1. Deep Learning</h2>

This program implements a Convolutional Neural Network through transfer learning on the Resnet50 model and additional fully-connected layers.
The model is trained using the PyTorch library on the CNRPark dataset. The CNRPark dataset was downloaded and sorted into train, test and validation sets irrespective of the weather conditions and camera angles of the overall image.
The smartpark-train Jupyter notebook (or the Python script) can be executed in Google Colab and also on CPU devices with suitable modifications to the directories
